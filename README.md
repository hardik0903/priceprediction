## 🔍 About the Project

The **Bangalore Price Prediction** project is designed to tackle the complexities of the dynamic Bangalore real estate market. By analyzing historical property data—incorporating details like area (in sq. ft.), number of BHKs, bathrooms, and location—the model provides accurate price estimates that reflect real market conditions.

Key aspects include:

- **Data-Driven Analysis:** Leveraging rich datasets to capture market trends.
- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Utilizes multiple regression techniques such as **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, and **Decision Tree Regression**.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Employs **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune models for optimal performance.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Delivers instant insights to help users make informed real estate decisions.

Let our model be your guide in navigating Bangalore's bustling property market! 🌆💼
